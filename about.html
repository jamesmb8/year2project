            We are a company which is chocolate orientated. We take in mass orders for the great range of chocolate products that we
            have in store. Our company is eager to provide you, the customer, with prices that simply cannot be beaten. We are a fairly
            sized company located in England, London and we became an established business in 1967. We have therefore been in the chocolate
            industry long enough to know what we are talking about when it comes to the topic of confectionaries. Our purpose is to supply the retail business with fine quality chocolate. We have a range of warehouses which allow
            us to store mass amounts of different chocolates.

            The features of our website allow the user to track their order numbers immediately after they have placed an order.
            This can be done through their account page and will show the order ID alongside the item and quantity, and price of that item they 
            have ordered. 

            As well as this, the user will also be able to change their password at any time through their account page, too. This 
            means that they will be able to ensure further security at all times by being able to constantly change their log-in details.

            A further feature that our website allows for is for the user to view all the items in their basket at all times through
            the top of our item dashboard page. This means that the user is able to add more or less of a pre-existing item in their basket
